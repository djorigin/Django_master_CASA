# Aircraft Detail View Fix - Complete Resolution

## 🎯 **ISSUE RESOLVED: Aircraft Detail View Missing**

### **✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**
**Problem**: Template field name mismatches prevented aircraft detail view from working properly
- **Template Used**: `aircraft.aircraft_id` (non-existent field)
- **Correct Field**: `aircraft.registration_mark` 
- **Secondary Issue**: `aircraft.registration_number` → `aircraft.serial_number`

### **🔧 FIXES APPLIED**

#### **1. Aircraft List Template (`aircraft_list.html`)**
- **Before**: `{{ aircraft.aircraft_id }}` → ❌ AttributeError
- **After**: `{{ aircraft.registration_mark }}` → ✅ Working
- **Before**: `{{ aircraft.registration_number }}` → ❌ AttributeError  
- **After**: `{{ aircraft.serial_number }}` → ✅ Working

#### **2. Table Headers Updated**
- **Before**: "Aircraft ID" / "Registration" 
- **After**: "Registration Mark" / "Serial Number" (accurate labels)

#### **3. Dashboard Template (`dashboard.html`)**
- **Before**: `{{ aircraft.aircraft_id }}` → ❌ AttributeError
- **After**: `{{ aircraft.registration_mark }}` → ✅ Working

#### **4. JavaScript References**

- **After**: `data-aircraft-name="{{ aircraft.registration_mark|escapejs }}"`
