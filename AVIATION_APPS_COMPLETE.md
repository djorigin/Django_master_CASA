### 5. Flight Operations App (`flight_operations/`)
**Purpose**: Mission planning, flight execution, and crew management

**Models**:
- `Mission`: RPA operation planning and authorization management
- `FlightPlan`: Detailed flight planning with CASA compliance validation
- `FlightLog`: Comprehensive flight record keeping and performance tracking

**Key Features**:
- Mission lifecycle management (planning → active → completed)
- CASA-compliant flight planning with VLOS/BVLOS support
- Auto-generated IDs (MSN-YYYY-XXXXXX, FPL-YYYY-XXXXXX, LOG-YYYY-XXXXXX)
- Weather conditions and safety procedure documentation
- Crew assignment and operational area coordination
- Flight performance data collection and analysis
- Risk assessment and CASA authorization tracking

**CASA Compliance**:
- Part 101 flight operation requirements
- VLOS altitude and range validation (120ft, 500m limits)
- Weather minimums and NOTAM checking
- Emergency and lost link procedures
- Flight time and performance logging

## Database Schema Integration

### Foreign Key Relationships
```
accounts.ClientProfile ← aircraft.Aircraft (owner/operator)
accounts.ClientProfile ← flight_operations.Mission (client)
accounts.PilotProfile ← incidents.IncidentReport (pilot_in_command)
accounts.PilotProfile ← flight_operations.FlightPlan (pilot_in_command/observer)
accounts.StaffProfile ← maintenance.MaintenanceRecord (performed_by/supervised_by)
accounts.StaffProfile ← flight_operations.Mission (mission_commander)
aircraft.Aircraft ← maintenance.MaintenanceRecord (aircraft)
aircraft.Aircraft ← incidents.IncidentReport (aircraft)
aircraft.Aircraft ← flight_operations.FlightPlan (aircraft)
airspace.AirspaceClass ← airspace.OperationalArea (airspace_class)
airspace.OperationalArea ← flight_operations.FlightPlan (operational_area)
flight_operations.Mission ← flight_operations.FlightPlan (mission)
flight_operations.FlightPlan ← flight_operations.FlightLog (flight_plan - OneToOne)
```

### Auto-Generated Identifiers
- Aircraft: Registration marks with validation
- Maintenance: MNT-YYYY-XXXXXX format
- Incidents: INC-YYYY-XXXXXX format
- Operational Areas: OA-XXXXXX format
- Missions: MSN-YYYY-XXXXXX format
- Flight Plans: FPL-YYYY-XXXXXX format
- Flight Logs: LOG-YYYY-XXXXXX format

## Admin Interface Features

### Color-Coded Status Indicators
- **Green**: Compliant/Operational/Current
- **Orange**: Warning/Due Soon/Requires Attention
- **Red**: Non-compliant/Overdue/Critical
- **Gray**: Inactive/Unknown

### Compliance Dashboards
- Aircraft operational status overview
- Maintenance due date tracking
- Incident CASA reporting status
- Airspace authorization requirements

### Advanced Filtering
- Multi-level filtering by compliance status
- Date-range filtering for scheduling
- Geographic area filtering
- Regulatory category filtering

## Validation & Business Rules

### Aircraft Validation
- Excluded category weight limits (≤25kg)
- Micro RPA validation (≤250g)
- Commercial operation certificate requirements
- Maintenance currency validation

### Maintenance Validation
- Licensed engineer requirements
- CASA form completion checks
