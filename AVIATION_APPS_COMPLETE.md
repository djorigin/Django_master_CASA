# CASA Part 101 Aviation Apps Architecture - COMPLETED

## Overview
Successfully implemented specialized Django apps structure for CASA Part 101 regulatory compliance. Each app follows single-responsibility principles and provides comprehensive coverage of aviation operations management.

## Implemented Apps Structure

### 1. Aircraft App (`aircraft/`)
**Purpose**: Aircraft registration, type certification, and compliance management

**Models**:
- `AircraftType`: CASA Part 101 aircraft type classifications with validation
- `Aircraft`: Individual aircraft registration and operational status

**Key Features**:
- CASA category validation (excluded, micro, small, medium, large)
- Airworthiness certificate tracking
- Insurance and maintenance status monitoring
- Compliance properties (`is_operational`, `is_airworthy`, etc.)
- Integration with accounts app for owner/operator relationships

**CASA Compliance**:
- Part 101.073 excluded category validation
- Type certificate requirements for commercial operations
- Maintenance scheduling and tracking
- Registration mark validation

### 2. Maintenance App (`maintenance/`)
**Purpose**: Maintenance scheduling, records, and regulatory compliance

**Models**:
- `MaintenanceType`: Maintenance categories and scheduling parameters
- `MaintenanceRecord`: Individual maintenance records with full audit trail

**Key Features**:
- CASA-compliant maintenance types (daily, periodic, 100-hour, annual)
- Licensed engineer requirements tracking
- Auto-generated maintenance IDs (MNT-YYYY-XXXXXX format)
- Cost tracking and labor hours
- Return to service authorization
- Overdue maintenance detection

**CASA Compliance**:
- Form 337 and documentation requirements
- Licensed engineer supervision tracking
- Maintenance interval validation
- Compliance status reporting

### 3. Incidents App (`incidents/`)
**Purpose**: Safety incident reporting and investigation management

**Models**:
- `IncidentType`: CASA incident classifications and reporting requirements
- `IncidentReport`: Comprehensive incident reports with investigation tracking

**Key Features**:
- CASA reportable incident identification
- Automatic reporting timeframe validation
- Investigation workflow management
- Auto-generated incident IDs (INC-YYYY-XXXXXX format)
- Geographic location tracking
- Environmental conditions recording
- Follow-up action management

**CASA Compliance**:
- Part 101 incident reporting requirements
- Investigation completion tracking
- CASA reference number management
- Immediate notification alerts for critical incidents

### 4. Airspace App (`airspace/`)
**Purpose**: Airspace classification and operational area management

**Models**:
- `AirspaceClass`: Australian airspace classifications (A, C, D, E, G)
- `OperationalArea`: Defined geographic areas with operational parameters

**Key Features**:
- CASA airspace class definitions
- Authorization level requirements
- Geographic boundary management (GeoJSON support)
- Time-based restrictions
- Altitude limit management
- Distance calculation utilities
- Active status validation

**CASA Compliance**:
- Class-specific RPA operation rules
- Authorization requirement tracking
- Controlled airspace coordination
- NOTAM and AIP reference integration

## Database Schema Integration

### Foreign Key Relationships
```
accounts.ClientProfile ← aircraft.Aircraft (owner/operator)
accounts.PilotProfile ← incidents.IncidentReport (pilot_in_command)
accounts.StaffProfile ← maintenance.MaintenanceRecord (performed_by/supervised_by)
aircraft.Aircraft ← maintenance.MaintenanceRecord (aircraft)
aircraft.Aircraft ← incidents.IncidentReport (aircraft)
airspace.AirspaceClass ← airspace.OperationalArea (airspace_class)
```

### Auto-Generated Identifiers
- Aircraft: Registration marks with validation
- Maintenance: MNT-YYYY-XXXXXX format
- Incidents: INC-YYYY-XXXXXX format
- Operational Areas: OA-XXXXXX format

## Admin Interface Features

### Color-Coded Status Indicators
- **Green**: Compliant/Operational/Current
- **Orange**: Warning/Due Soon/Requires Attention
- **Red**: Non-compliant/Overdue/Critical
- **Gray**: Inactive/Unknown

### Compliance Dashboards
- Aircraft operational status overview
- Maintenance due date tracking
- Incident CASA reporting status
- Airspace authorization requirements

### Advanced Filtering
- Multi-level filtering by compliance status
- Date-range filtering for scheduling
- Geographic area filtering
- Regulatory category filtering

## Validation & Business Rules

### Aircraft Validation
- Excluded category weight limits (≤25kg)
- Micro RPA validation (≤250g)
- Commercial operation certificate requirements
- Maintenance currency validation

### Maintenance Validation
- Licensed engineer requirements
- CASA form completion checks
- Maintenance interval validation
- Return to service authorization

### Incident Validation
- CASA reporting timeframe compliance
- Investigation completion requirements
- Geographic coordinate validation
- Status transition rules

### Airspace Validation
- Coordinate range validation (-90/90, -180/180)
- Altitude parameter consistency
- Time restriction validation
- GeoJSON format validation

## API Integration Ready

All models include:
- Comprehensive `__str__` methods for API serialization
- Property methods for calculated fields
- Clean validation methods for data integrity
- Optimized querysets for performance
